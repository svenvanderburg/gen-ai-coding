### Details

Setup for different systems can be presented in dropdown menus via a `spoiler`
tag. They will join to this discussion block, so you can give a general overview
of the software used in this lesson here and fill out the individual operating
systems (and potentially add more, e.g. online setup) in the solutions blocks.
